# Backend for Annaforces

This is the backend for the Annaforces project.

## Data Structure

For a detailed understanding of how problems, submissions, users, and solutions are structured and stored, please refer to the [DATA/README.md](../DATA/README.md) file. The templates for creating new problems, contests, and solutions are now located in the [DATA/blueprint](../DATA/blueprint) directory.

## Deployment

The backend is deployed at: `http://localhost:5000/`

## Data Model Changes

The data model has been updated to use `username` as the primary identifier for users, deprecating the old `user_id`. This change is reflected across the entire application, including the database schema, API endpoints, and frontend components.

## Services

### GitHub Service

The `services/github_services.py` file provides a set of functions to interact with a GitHub repository. This service is used to manage the data stored in the `DATA` repository.

**Write Operation Queue:** To prevent race conditions and data corruption from concurrent writes, all file creation and update operations are funneled through a simple in-memory queue. A dedicated background thread processes this queue, ensuring that all write operations to the GitHub repository are executed sequentially. This makes the system more robust in a single-instance deployment.

**Read Operation Caching:** Implemented a caching layer for read operations (`get_file`, `get_folder_contents`) to reduce redundant GitHub API calls and improve performance. The cache can be explicitly invalidated.

### OTP and Email Service

The `services/email_service.py` module handles OTP generation and sending via email using Flask-Mail. This is primarily used for user email verification during registration, sending welcome emails, user ID reminders, and password reset OTPs.

#### Environment Variables

To use the services, you need to set the following environment variables in a `.env` file in the root of the `backend-for-annaforces` directory:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope.
- `GITHUB_REPO`: The name of the GitHub repository where the data is stored.
- `GITHUB_OWNER`: The owner of the GitHub repository.
- `JUDGE_API_SERVER_URL`: The URL of the code execution server.
- `MAIL_SERVER`: SMTP server address (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`).
- `MAIL_PORT`: SMTP server port (e.g., `587`).
- `MAIL_USE_TLS`: Set to `True` for TLS encryption.
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: The email address used to send OTPs.
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`: The app password for the sending email address.
- `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER`: The default sender email address.

### Firebase Service

The `services/firebase_service.py` handles user authentication and management using Google Firebase Firestore. It provides functionalities for adding, retrieving, and verifying user credentials.

#### Environment Variables

To use the Firebase service, you need to set the following environment variable in a `.env` file in the root of the `backend-for-annaforces` directory:

- `FIREBASE_DB_CREDENTIALS`: The JSON content of your Firebase service account key. This should be a single, unquoted JSON string.

### Submission Service

The `services/submission_service.py` handles the submission of solutions by users. It now uses a persistent, MongoDB-based queue to make the submission process more robust and responsive.

#### Submission Flow with MongoDB Queue

1.  **Queueing:** When a user submits a solution, the submission is added to a `submissions_queue` collection in MongoDB with a status of `in_queue`.
2.  **Immediate Response:** The API immediately returns a `submission_id` and an `in_queue` status to the user.
3.  **Background Worker:** A background worker thread continuously polls the `submissions_queue` for new submissions.
4.  **Grading:** When a new submission is picked up, its status is set to `grading`, and it is passed to the `judge_service`.
5.  **GitHub and Database Update:** After grading, the final results and submission files are created in the GitHub repository, and a corresponding document is added to the `submissions` collection in MongoDB.
6.  **Cleanup:** The submission is removed from the `submissions_queue` in MongoDB.

#### Live Status Updates

During the grading process, the `judge_service` provides real-time status updates. As it processes each test case, it updates the submission's status in the `submissions_queue` collection to `running test case {i + 1}`. This allows the frontend to poll the submission status and provide live feedback to the user.

### Judge Service

The `services/judge_service.py` is responsible for evaluating submitted code. It now accepts a `submission_id` in its `grade_submission` function to facilitate live status updates.

For each test case, the `judge_service` first calls the `/api/execute` endpoint on the executor service. If the code runs successfully, it then calls the `/api/validate` endpoint on the same service, passing the validator code, the user's output, and the test case input to get a verdict. The validator code is read from the `validator.py` file within the problem's directory in the `DATA` repository. This verdict is then then used to determine the status of the test case.

### Problem Service

The `services/problem_service.py` is responsible for managing problems. It handles the creation of new problems, including validation of the problem data.

#### Problem Management

Problems are added and managed manually by directly modifying the `DATA` repository. The backend services will then read and serve these problems.

### Utils

The `utils` directory contains utility functions used throughout the backend application.

#### JWT Token

The `jwt_token.py` module provides functions for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication.

## Security Enhancements

Recent updates have focused on improving the security posture of the backend. Key enhancements include:

-   **Input Validation:** Stricter validation has been implemented for user-provided IDs (`user_id`, `submission_id`) to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Only IDs conforming to expected formats (e.g., `U123`, `S456`) are accepted.
-   **Language Whitelisting:** Code submission endpoints now enforce a whitelist for programming languages (`python`, `c`, `c++`) to ensure only supported and safe languages are processed by the judge service.

-   **Email Enumeration Prevention:** The `/api/auth/forgot-userid` endpoint now returns a generic success message, regardless of whether the email exists, to prevent attackers from enumerating valid user email addresses.
-   **Import Fixes:** Resolved import issues for email service functions (`send_password_reset_email`, `send_password_changed_confirmation_email`) ensuring proper functionality of password reset and confirmation emails.

-   **User Problem Status Tracking:** User `meta.json` files now include `attempted`, `solved`, and `not_solved` fields (stored as dictionaries for O(1) access). These fields are dynamically updated by `submission_service.py` and managed by `user_service.py` based on the outcome of each submission, providing a comprehensive history of a user's engagement with problems.

These measures contribute to a more robust and secure application.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Enhancements

-   **API Endpoint Refactoring:**
    -   `/api/auth/<username>/submissions`: New endpoint added to `auth_api.py` for fetching user submissions directly from MongoDB.
    -   `/api/problems/<problem_id>/submissions`: New endpoint added to `problems_api.py` for fetching problem submissions directly from MongoDB.
    -   `/api/submissions/<submission_id>`: New endpoint added to `submissions_api.py` for fetching single submission details directly from MongoDB.
    -   `/api/submissions/queue`: URL prefix changed from `/submissions` back to `/api/submissions` in `app.py`.
    -   `/api/contests`: `get_all_contests_metadata` in `contest_service.py` now fetches from MongoDB.
    -   `/api/contests/<contest_id>`: `get_contest_details` in `contest_service.py` now fetches from MongoDB and includes `status_info` (Upcoming, Running, Over). `get_contest` in `contests_api.py` now returns this directly.
    -   `/api/contests/<contest_id>/meta`: New endpoint added to `contests_api.py` for fetching contest metadata directly from MongoDB.

-   **Contest Status Logic:** Implemented robust logic in `contest_service.py` to determine and return the status of a contest (Upcoming, Running, Over) based on `startTime` and `endTime`.

-   **Leaderboard Removal:** The leaderboard API endpoint and all associated frontend components have been removed.

-   **Problem Details Consolidation:** The `/api/problems/<problem_id>` endpoint now consolidates all problem description elements (input, output, constraints, notes) into a single `problem_statement` field, removing separate fields from the API response.

-   **Bug Fixes:**
    -   `NameError: name 'mongo' is not defined` in `problems_api.py` and `submissions_api.py` fixed by importing `mongo`.
    -   `AttributeError: module 'services.submission_service' has no attribute 'get_submissions_queue'` fixed by adding `get_submissions_queue` to `submission_service.py`.
    -   `time data does not match format` error in `contest_service.py` fixed by updating `strptime` format to include microseconds.
    -   `NameError: name 'pytz' is not defined` in `contest_service.py` fixed by importing `pytz`.
    -   Caching issue for `meta.json` in `contest_service.py` fixed by adding `force_refresh=True` to `get_file`.

- **Submission Process:**
  - Fixed a critical bug where the `language` and `code` arguments were swapped during the submission process, leading to incorrect storage of submission details.
  - Refactored the submission processing logic to prevent race conditions during GitHub file updates and ensure accurate saving of test results. Live updates of test case results to GitHub during grading have been temporarily disabled to ensure data integrity.
- **Problems API:**
  - Fixed a bug in the `/api/problems/<problem_id>/submissions` endpoint that caused a 500 error when a problem had no submissions. The endpoint now correctly returns an empty list.
  - Fixed an indentation error in `problems_api.py` that caused a syntax issue.
- **Contest Data:**
  - Adjusted the `startTime` for contest `C2` in `DATA/data/contests/C2/meta.json` to ensure problems associated with it are revealed as intended.
- **GitHub Service:**
  - Fixed an issue where files larger than 1MB could not be fetched from GitHub. The service now uses the `download_url` for large files.
- **Submission Service:**
  - Fixed an issue where the submission service was not returning detailed test results.
  - Fixed a bug that caused the service to crash if there was an error adding a submission to the database.
  - Corrected a syntax error that prevented the service from returning any value.
- **Judge Service:**
  - Fixed a bug related to tuple indexing when fetching test cases.
  - Corrected the path for fetching test cases to correctly locate them within the contest-specific problem directory.
- **API:**
  - Standardized the language parameter for C++ submissions to "c++". Submissions with "cpp" are now automatically converted.
- **User Service:** Fixed a `WriteError` in `user_service.py` that occurred when updating user problem status in MongoDB.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the backend, navigate to the `backend-for-annaforces` directory and use the `pytest` command.

### Running All Tests (Utils Folder)

To run all `unittest` tests specifically for the `utils` folder, execute the `test_all.py` script:

```bash
python tests/utils/test_all.py
```

This script will automatically discover and run all `unittest` tests in `tests/utils`.

### Running Specific Tests

You can also run specific test files directly using Python. For example, to run the JWT token tests:

```bash
python tests/utils/test_jwt_token.py
```

To run the Email Service tests:

```bash
python tests/services/test_email_service.py
```

These test files use the `unittest` framework and include necessary `sys.path` adjustments for module imports.

The `-s` flag is recommended to see the output of any `print` statements within the tests.

For more details on the tests, see the `README.md` file in the `tests` directory.

## API Endpoints

### Auth API

The `/api/auth/login` endpoint handles user authentication. It expects a `username` and `password` in the request body. Upon successful authentication, it returns a JWT token. If the user is not found, a specific error message is returned.

**Example to get a token:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "password123"}' http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
```

### Problems API

**PDF Support**

The API now supports PDF versions of problem statements and solutions. 

- The `/api/problems/<problem_id>` endpoint will now include a `has_pdf_statement` boolean flag.
- The `/api/problems/<problem_id>/solution` endpoint will now include a `has_pdf_solution` boolean flag.

If these flags are true, you can use the following endpoints to retrieve the PDF data:

- `/api/problems/<problem_id>/statement.pdf`: Returns a JSON object with the base64 encoded PDF data for the problem statement.
- `/api/problems/<problem_id>/solution.pdf`: Returns a JSON object with the base64 encoded PDF data for the solution.
